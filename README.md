# Project: 2 Memory Game
# Creator: Jennifer Hong

## What You Can Do Using the File 
 This game is designed to help you improve your memory. There are 8 matching sets of cards in the game. 
 
 When you click on each card, it'll show you a symbol. The goal is to match each card with its twin in the deck using the least amount of moves possible by remembering where each card is positioned.
 
 You will be able to see the number of moves, timer, and win counts (# of matches) as you play in the scoreboard at top. 
 
 You will also be given a star rating based on how many moves it takes you to find the matches. 
 
 If you want to reset the game, you can do so by clicking 'start over'. 
 
 Once the game is done, a message would pop up to show you your scores, total time and total # of moves with an option to start a new game.
